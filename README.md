# ‚ö° Optimal Bidding Strategies in ISO Energy Markets using Reinforcement Learning

**Capstone Project (Sept 2025 ‚Äì Apr 2026)**  
**Queen‚Äôs University ‚Äî Department of Applied Mathematics & Engineering**  
**In collaboration with Enverus (a Blackstone subsidiary)**

## üìò Overview

This project develops a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** framework to derive **optimal bidding strategies** across **Independent System Operator (ISO)** energy markets in North America.  
Rather than focusing on a single ISO (e.g., ISO-NE or PJM), the framework is designed to be **generalizable across multiple market structures**, enabling adaptive and data-driven bidding strategies that account for regional differences in price formation, demand patterns, and dispatch mechanisms.

The environment is modeled as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, where each agent‚Äôs actions correspond to bid submissions and the state captures current market conditions.  
By combining **Q-Learning**, **forecasting models**, and **multi-agent game-theoretic elements**, the system aims to identify bidding policies that maximize long-term expected profit under uncertainty.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a **Q-Learning‚Äìbased bidding agent** capable of operating across multiple ISO markets.  
- Integrate **market price forecasting** using SARIMAX and related time-series models.  
- Extend to **multi-agent settings** to simulate competitive bidding dynamics.  
- Benchmark performance against baseline heuristic and rule-based strategies.  
- Build a modular and reproducible codebase compatible with industrial datasets provided by Enverus.

## üß† Technical Approach

### 1. Problem Modeling
- Market environment modeled as a **stochastic MDP**:
  - **State:** price signals, load forecasts, generation mix, time features  
  - **Action:** bid price and quantity pairs  
  - **Reward:** realized profit or surplus per dispatch interval  
- Policies œÄ(a|s) learned to maximize discounted cumulative reward.

### 2. Learning Algorithms
- **Tabular Q-Learning** baseline for interpretability.  
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** extensions via `stable-baselines3` and `d3rlpy`.  
- Exploration strategies:
  - Œµ-greedy  
  - Boltzmann (Softmax) exploration  

### 3. Forecasting Integration
- **SARIMAX** models for short-term price prediction.  
- Forecasts incorporated as exogenous variables within the RL state representation.  

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Mean cumulative reward per episode  
- Profit variance and Sharpe-like ratios  
- Convergence behavior of Q-values  
- Cross-ISO generalization performance
